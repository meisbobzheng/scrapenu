While millons of people worldwide are displaced by war and other forms of violence, the history of forced migration and processes of seeking and granting refuge are often poorly understood. Investigates the development of legal and institutional frameworks that govern forced migration and assesses its political and humanitarian implications. Rejecting dominant views of displaced people as victims or as problems to solve, the course addresses displaced people as complex historical actors whose experiences are tied to legacies and processes of imperialism, state violence, war, and globalization.",

According to the World Health Organization, some 15 percent of the worlds population lives with disability. Yet what exactly is a disability? Successful students are expected to become conversant with theories of the social-historical construction of disabilities, the differences between visible and invisible impairments, the contributions of disability rights activism, and the bioethical questions about difference raised by medical technologies.",

Focuses on individual projects and the political circumstances tied to their making. Also considers the afterlife of projects associated with discredited regimesespecially those of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italyas well as the ways in which private individuals, corporations, and other agencies have worked in tandem or in opposition to official narratives.Theoretical and critical texts that explore the dynamic between physical environment and political power help frame class discussion at key moments.",

Offers students an opportunity to learn to analyze, critique, and iteratively design innovative game user interfaces; learn about and practice game usability and game feel, as well as design techniques for user interfaces and user experience; and focus on designing innovative game interfaces as they iteratively develop and test a game interface from beginning to end, resulting in a portfolio-ready game interface prototype. Designed as an intermediate course for undergraduate students across disciplines.",

Addresses punks long narrative: protopunk genres including garage rock and glam rock; punks origins in New York City and London; its transformation into postpunk, hardcore, anarcho-punk, and straightedge; and its legacy outside the United States/United Kingdom nexus and in genres such as riot grrrl, grunge, and pop-punk.",
